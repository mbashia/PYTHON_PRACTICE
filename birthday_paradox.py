# the birthday paradox, also called the birthday problem, is the surprisingly high probability that two
# people will have the same birthday even in a small group of people. In a group of 70 people, there's
# a 99.9 percent chance of two people having a matching birthday. But even in a group as small as 23 people, there's
# 50 percent chance of a matching birthday.This program performs several probability experiments to determine the
# percentages for groups of different sizes. We call these types of experiments,
# in which we conuct multiple random trials to undersand the likely outcomes, Monte Carlo experiments
